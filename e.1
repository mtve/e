replace, goto line

file loaded entirely in memory, you are limited only to what realloc(3) return

.Sh HINTS
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
you can edit binary files because
.Nm
doesn't format anything; it will leave this to your terminal
.It
to reset block selection put ending mark before or at beginning mark (^B^E)
.It
you can convert Dos files (crlf) to Unix (lf) easily: while pressing
Ctrl print trqmmmnnnnnnnnn... :)
.It
and back to Dos: trqjmqmqjmnnn...
.It
Further to that, be careful with Ctrl while printing something like 'tboed'
.It
there is no autosave or anything like that, so backup your data
.El
.Sh BUGS
many operations on every getch: erase() and COLS*LINES addch(),
but I don't think it's so bad (scrolling is optimised, so on telnet session
to 386 I feel the same speed as vi).
.Sh COPYING
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
As is, no warranties at all
.It
You can do with these sources whatever you want (WTFPL) 
it.
