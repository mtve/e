`e' version 0.994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`e' is minimalistic text editor
- inspired by Norton Editor for DOS
- insert/replace mode, block operations with highlighting, find and replace,
  goto line
- writed on C with ncurses, should compile anywhere
- tested with
   - FreeBSD 2.2.8-9.3
   - RedHat 6.2
   - SunOS 2.6-10
- file loaded entirely in memory, you limited only to what realloc(3) return

Hints
~~~~~
- you can edit binary files because `e' don't format anything
- to reset block selection put ending mark before or at beginning mark (^B^E)
- you can convert Dos files (crlf) to Unix (lf) easily: while pressing
Ctrl print trqmmmnnnnnnnnn... :)
- and back to Dos: trqjmqmqjmnnn...
- by analogy be careful to Ctrl while printing something like 'tboed'
- there is no autosave or some kind of that, so backup your data in time 

Bugs
~~~~
- many operations on every getch: erase() and COLS*LINES addch(),
but i don't think its so bad (scrolling is optimised, so on telnet session
to 386 i feel the same speed like vi).
- bad documentation, which counts only this file in terrible english
without man page, i would be very thankful if someone can write it

Copyrights
~~~~~~~~~~
- as is, no warranties at all
- you can do with this sources whatever you want (WTFPL)
